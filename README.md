Bugs
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
* Login doesn't require a password at present.
* Once the app is closed, the user is required to login again by providing credentials.
* Because instamojo payment gateway is used, there is a limit on transaction amount.
  Minimum transaction amount is Rs 11, though, transaction above Rs 100 is preferred.
  Maximum transaction limit is 2 lacs per transaction.
* During payment procedure, cancel option is not in a working state at present.
* In the profile section, the details - Phone, Spendings, Earnings and Rewards are regularly updated.
  At present, the rest of the details are hardcoded and fixed. Also, though the rewards are updated regularly,
  they cannot be used in any transaction.
* At present, the Offers section is hardcoded and will be updated in future. The offers are not dynamic.
* After the final payment, the instamojo payment receipt is sent immediately to the e-mail ID provided by the user.
  Although, the app payment confirmation is sent to the same app e-mail id : raseedinc@gmail.com
