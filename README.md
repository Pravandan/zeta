Bugs
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
* Login doesn't require a password at present.
* Once the app is closed, the user is required to login again by providing credentials.
* Because instamojo payment gateway is used, maximum transaction limit is 2 lacs per transaction.
* During payment procedure, cancel option is not in a working state at present.
* In the profile section, the details - Phone, Spendings, Earnings and Rewards are regularly updated.
  At present, the rest of the details are hardcoded and fixed. Also, though the rewards get updated regularly, 
  they are never converted to money.
* At present, the Offers section is hardcoded and will be updated in future. The offers are not dynamic.
* After the final payment, the instamojo payment receipt is sent immediately to the e-mail ID provided by the user.
  Although, the app payment confirmation is sent to the same app e-mail id : raseedinc@gmail.com
